# SupplyChainGPT — Council of Debate AI Agents

**A Multi-Agent Intelligence Framework for Supply Chain Risk, Optimization & Brand Resilience**

> Imagine a boardroom of specialized AI experts — each with a unique role, perspective, and domain expertise — who debate, challenge, predict, and collectively decide the best course of action for any supply chain query or crisis.

Instead of a single AI giving one answer, the Council runs multiple specialized agents in parallel, each arguing their perspective, and a Moderator Agent synthesizes the final, balanced decision. This is powered by LangGraph multi-agent orchestration, where agents have memory, tools, and the ability to challenge each other's outputs before giving a final recommendation.

**Hackathon**: Cognizant Technoverse 2026  
**Team**: Rohith, Akhil, Poojitha, Aishwarya  
**Timeline**: 9 Days (April 12–20, 2026)

## Council Debate Protocol

### Step-by-Step Flow

**QUERY**: "What is our exposure if Supplier X (Taiwan) fails due to geopolitical tensions this quarter?"

#### Round 1: Individual Agent Analysis (Parallel Processing)

| Agent | Output |
|-------|--------|
| Risk Agent | "Risk Score: 87/100. Disruption likely in 21 days" |
| Supply Agent | "3 alternates found. Best: India supplier" |
| Logistics Agent | "Reroute adds 8 days. Air freight available" |
| Market Agent | "Chip prices spike 34% if Taiwan supply stops" |
| Finance Agent | "Exposure: $4.2M in outstanding POs" |
| Brand Agent | "Low social risk now. Pre-emptive comms ready" |

#### Round 2: Debate — Agents Challenge Each Other

- **Supply Agent challenges Logistics Agent**: "India supplier needs 12-day onboarding. Your 8-day reroute creates a 4-day production gap. How do we bridge this?"
- **Logistics Agent responds**: "Bridge via emergency air freight from Vietnam (Supplier C) for 4-day gap period. Cost: $85K one-time. Acceptable?"
- **Finance Agent responds**: "$85K bridge cost vs $4.2M exposure = 98% ROI. Approve."
- **Market Agent challenges Supply Agent**: "India supplier Tier 2 sources from same Taiwan chip fab. They will also be impacted. True independence unverified."
- **Supply Agent revises**: "Verified: India supplier uses Korean Tier 2 source. Safe."

#### Round 3: Final Synthesis by Moderator Agent

**FINAL COUNCIL RECOMMENDATION:**
1. Switch 60% volume to India supplier (Confidence: 94%)
2. 4-day gap bridged via Vietnam air freight ($85K)
3. Forward-buy 6-month chip stock (Market Agent forecast)
4. Financial hedge: Cover $4.2M PO exposure (Finance Agent)
5. Pre-draft brand communication — activate only if needed
6. Monitor Taiwan situation daily via Risk Agent

## Risk Scoring Pipeline

### Signal Ingestion
Collect risk signals from multiple sources: news events (GDELT, NewsAPI), shipment delays (carrier APIs), supplier financials (ERP), geopolitical indices, social sentiment.

### Signal Normalization
Convert signals into comparable numeric features.

### Score Aggregation
Combine features into a transparent score (weighted) or a model score (XGBoost).

### Evidence Attachment
Store why the score changed (event tags, lane delays, PO impact).

### Output
- **Risk score**: 0–100 (or Low/Medium/High)
- **Drivers**: top 3–5 factors
- **Impacted items**: list of affected components/POs
- **Suggested actions**: triggers Council analysis

---

## RAG (GenAI Q&A) Pipeline

### What RAG is Used For
RAG is used to answer questions using **your documents**, not guesswork:
- SOPs (what to do during a disruption)
- Contracts (SLAs, penalties, force majeure clauses — only where allowed)
- Past incident reports (what worked, what failed)
- Supplier onboarding checklists

### Typical Flow
1. Chunk documents → embed chunks → store vectors
2. On query: retrieve top-K chunks
3. LLM answers using only retrieved context + citations to internal doc IDs

### Example Queries
- "What is our SOP if a critical supplier lead time increases by 2 weeks?"
- "What steps are required to qualify an alternate supplier for Component C2?"
- "Summarize the last incident involving port congestion and what we changed."

---

## Optimization (OR-Tools)

SupplyChainGPT uses OR-Tools for actionable planning under constraints.

### Supported Optimization Patterns
| Pattern | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Routing** | Choose route/mode/carrier minimizing cost while meeting delivery deadline |
| **Allocation** | Split demand across suppliers based on capacity, MOQ, lead time, and risk |
| **Expedite tradeoffs** | Compare (reroute) vs (air freight) vs (safety stock usage) |

### Example Constraints
- Lead time ≤ target
- Budget ≤ limit
- Supplier capacity ≤ available
- MOQ constraints
- Service level targets

- **Day 5 Afternoon** ✅: Vite + React 18 + TS scaffold. Tailwind config with brand colors + shadcn tokens. Type definitions, API client, WebSocket client, Zustand stores, custom hooks, Navbar, shared components, 5 page routes + 404, Vite proxy config. Production build passes with zero TS errors.
- **Day 7 Morning**: Implement Dashboard (heatmap + stats) + Chat page with streaming input
- **Day 7 Afternoon**: Debate page with timeline + charts + modals for Audit/Fallback
- **Day 8 Morning**: Brand page polish + Settings page + WebSocket integration
- **Day 8 Afternoon**: Polish (responsive, loading states, dark theme, export buttons) + connect to backend
- **Day 9**: Final polish, deployment, testing on AWS

### UI/UX Best Practices for Judges
- Minimalist dark theme (blue-purple accents matching Cognizant branding)
- Ample whitespace, subtle animations (framer-motion for modals)
- All actions have clear feedback (toasts + loading spinners)
- One-click flows: Query → Council → Debate → Fallbacks (all in < 10 seconds demo)

---

## Demo Scenario

Use this scenario in presentations and end-to-end demo:

**Assume a mid-size manufacturer:**
- 1 plant, 50 SKUs, ~40 active suppliers
- 3 critical components (C1, C2, C3) sourced from Tier-1 Supplier **S1**
- Supplier S1 depends on Tier-2 Supplier **T2** in another region

**Trigger**: News signal about **port strike** near Tier-2 region + rising shipment delays

**Expected Council behavior:**
1. Risk Agent raises risk score for affected lane/suppliers with evidence
2. Sourcing Agent suggests 2 alternates with lead times + qualification notes
3. Logistics Agent proposes reroute vs air freight tradeoff
4. Finance Agent estimates cost impact range (mitigation cost vs disruption exposure)
5. Brand Agent provides customer messaging template + advertising pivot suggestion

   ```
5. Copy `.env.example` → `.env` and fill all keys (use hackathon AWS credentials)

#### Afternoon (3 hours) – Architecture & Core State
1. Draw architecture diagram (use draw.io or Excalidraw): Council flow → Moderator → 7 Agents → Debate Engine → RAG + MCP. Export as PNG
2. Create `backend/state.py`: Define `CouncilState` TypedDict with fields: `query`, `messages`, `risk_score`, `recommendation`, `confidence`, `debate_history`, `fallback_options`
3. Create `backend/graph.py`: Basic `StateGraph` with Moderator node (use official LangGraph supervisor pattern)
4. Add LangSmith tracing: `langsmith_client = Client()` and enable in every run

#### Evening (2–3 hours) – FastAPI Skeleton + PDF Submission
1. Create `backend/api.py`: FastAPI app with endpoint `/council/query` (async) that runs the graph
2. Add health check `/health` and basic error middleware
3. Run locally: `uv run uvicorn backend.api:app --reload` → test with curl
4. Update Idea PDF:
   - Add architecture diagram (Technical Details section)
   - Add "9-Day Production Timeline" table
   - Add one-line statement: "Built as 4-page React SPA with Radix modals"
5. Submit PDF on Superset platform before midnight

**Production Feature**: Full LangSmith tracing enabled from Day 1 + Docker-ready `docker-compose.yml` stub (Postgres + Redis)

**Output by 11:59 PM**: Working FastAPI server + basic LangGraph graph running locally. Commit to `main` with message "Day 1 foundation complete"

---

### Day 2 (April 13) – Core LangGraph Council (7 Agents Skeleton)

**Total Time**: 8–10 hours

#### Morning (3 hours) – 7 Agent Nodes + Supervisor
1. In `backend/agents/` create 7 files: `risk_agent.py`, `supply_agent.py`, `logistics_agent.py`, `market_agent.py`, `finance_agent.py`, `brand_agent.py`, `moderator.py`
2. Use template from LangGraph and multi-agent repos: Each agent is a simple ReAct node with `tools=[]` (MCP will be added on Day 4)
3. Create `supervisor.py`: Use `create_supervisor` or custom StateGraph with conditional edges (parallel execution for first 6 agents)
4. Implement basic agent prompt templates (role-specific system prompts from the plan)

#### Afternoon (4 hours) – Checkpointer & Parallel Execution
1. Setup PostgreSQL + Redis via Docker (add to `docker-compose.yml`):
   ```yaml
   postgres:
     image: postgres:16
   redis:
     image: redis:7
   ```
2. Add `AsyncPostgresSaver` + `RedisCheckpointer` to the graph: `graph.compile(checkpointer=checkpointer)`
3. Enable parallel execution: Use `Send` or `parallel` node for Risk + Supply + Logistics + Market + Finance + Brand
4. Add structured output: Each agent returns Pydantic model with `confidence` (float 0-100) and `contribution`

#### Evening (2–3 hours) – Testing & Production Polish
1. Create `tests/test_council.py`: Run full Council with sample query "Taiwan chip crisis impact on our EV battery supply"
2. Add human-in-the-loop stub (`interrupt_before=["moderator"]`)
3. Enable LangSmith trace sharing (generate public link for demo)
4. Test: Single query → all 7 agents run in parallel → Moderator synthesizes → persisted state in Postgres

**Production Feature**: Persistent state across restarts + audit-ready `debate_history` list + confidence-weighted routing

**Output by 11:59 PM**: Fully working 7-agent Council that runs end-to-end with persistence. Commit to branch `feature/core-council` and merge to `main`

---

## Day 8–9 Detailed Plan

### Day 8 (April 19) – Production Polish & Security

**Total Time**: 8–10 hours

#### Morning (3–4 hours) – Security Hardening & Backend Polish
1. Add comprehensive security:
   - Prompt injection protection using LlamaGuard or custom guardrails in every agent
   - Rate limiting + CORS + API key authentication in FastAPI
   - PII redaction in Brand Agent outputs
   - MCP sandboxing with least-privilege scopes
2. Implement cost optimization:
   - Redis caching for RAG results and MCP responses (60%+ cost reduction)
   - LLM fallback (Groq → Claude on high latency)
   - Batch processing for multiple agent calls
3. Enhance observability:
   - Full LangSmith tracing with custom metadata (agent_name, confidence, mcp_calls)
   - Add Prometheus metrics endpoint for latency, token usage, error rate
   - Create simple Grafana dashboard JSON stub (for demo)

#### Afternoon (3–4 hours) – Frontend Integration & Polish
1. Complete integration of 4-page React SPA (from Day 7):
   - Dashboard, Chat, Debate, Brand pages fully connected to FastAPI via TanStack Query
   - Real-time debate streaming using Socket.io (show live agent contributions + confidence bars)
2. Add all Radix Dialogs/Modals:
   - Fallback & Action Plan (with ROI calculator + one-click "Execute" mock)
   - Audit & Observability Log (searchable table of debate_history + LangSmith public links)
   - Settings (MCP tools toggle, RAG upload, human-in-loop, LLM selector)
3. Polish UI/UX:
   - Minimalist dark theme with Cognizant blue-purple accents
   - Subtle animations (Framer Motion for modals and agent status)
   - Loading skeletons + toast notifications for every action
   - Responsive design (mobile-friendly for demo)

#### Evening (2 hours) – End-to-End Testing & Optimization
1. Run full integration tests on 8–10 disruption scenarios (Taiwan chip crisis, etc.)
2. Performance tuning: Ensure Council query completes in <8 seconds (target for live demo)
3. Add export features: Debate trail → PDF/JSON download
4. Record short screen recordings of key flows for your final presentation

**Output by 11:59 PM**: Fully integrated, secure, polished backend + frontend running locally. Commit to branch `feature/polish-security` and merge to `main`

---

### Day 9 (April 20) – Testing, Deployment & Submission Prep

2. Create production Dockerfile for backend (multi-stage build) and frontend (Vite build served via nginx or FastAPI static)
3. Deploy locally with Docker: `docker compose up --build`
4. Prepare AWS deployment script (hackathon environment): ECS/Fargate ready commands + environment variable injection

#### Afternoon (3–4 hours) – Comprehensive Testing & Load Simulation
1. E2E testing: Use pytest + Playwright for all 4 pages + modals
2. Load testing: Simulate 50 concurrent queries and verify persistence + tracing
3. Edge-case testing: Low confidence → self-reflection, MCP failure → cached fallback, human-in-loop interrupt
4. Quantify ROI in UI: Add live calculator showing $ savings, time saved, risk reduction based on sample runs

#### Evening (2–3 hours) – Final Prep & Documentation
1. Create polished demo script (3–5 minute flow: New Query → Council → Live Debate → Fallback Execution → Audit Log)
2. Update Idea PDF / presentation with:
   - Latest screenshots
   - Architecture + 4-page frontend diagram
   - Production metrics (latency, cost, accuracy)
   - 9-day timeline + future roadmap
3. Generate public LangSmith trace links + short demo video
4. Final git push + README with setup instructions, one-click run commands, and judge Q&A notes (21 questions)

**Output by 11:59 PM**: Live local + Docker-deployed system, complete repo, all deliverables ready. Tag release `v1.0-mvp` and prepare for Agent Builder Challenge on April 23.

- **Lint**: eslint

```bash
cd frontend
npm run build
```

### E2E
- **Framework**: pytest + Playwright
- **Coverage**: All 4 pages + modals

---

## Security & Responsible AI

- **Data minimization**: Ingest only fields needed for scoring and planning
- **Access control**: Role-based access (Procurement vs Finance vs Comms)
- **PII handling**: Avoid storing unnecessary personal data; mask where required
- **API key security**: All keys removed from `.env.example` (placeholders only), `google_api_key` and `gemini_api_key` removed from config, `extra = "ignore"` prevents crashes
- **Auth middleware**: `/market/*` endpoints are public, all other routes require API key
- **RAG grounding**: Answers should cite internal doc IDs; avoid free-form guessing
- **Auditability**: Store agent outputs and evidence references for review
- **Human-in-the-loop**: Suggestions should be reviewed before execution (especially supplier switches, customer communications, and financial actions)
- **Prompt injection hygiene**: Sanitize external content before adding to RAG context; isolate tools; restrict tool permissions per agent

---

## Deployment

### Docker / Compose
Run services: API, Web, Postgres, Neo4j, Redis  
Optional: add a worker container for async jobs

```bash
docker compose -f infra/docker-compose.yml up -d --build
```

### Kubernetes (optional)
Use `infra/k8s/` manifests for a multi-service deployment.  
Recommended: separate namespaces for dev/stage/prod.

### AWS
ECS/Fargate deployment with environment variable injection.

---

## Roadmap

- Add stronger **supplier qualification workflow** (checklists, approvals, evidence storage)
- Add **ESG/Sustainability agent** (certification tracking, ethical sourcing alerts)
- Improve forecasting and lane modeling with richer logistics data feeds
- Add "playbook automation" with approvals (generate PO drafts, carrier booking requests)
- Expand multi-language customer messaging templates (optional)

---

## Limitations / Non-goals

- This project does not aim to replace ERP/SCM systems; it complements them
- External data availability varies by region and vendor; some signals may be simulated in demos
- Risk scores are decision support, not guarantees
- Brand/advertising pivots are suggestions; final messaging should be reviewed by humans

---

## Contributing

1. Create a feature branch
2. Keep changes small and testable
3. Add or update tests for critical logic
4. Update docs if adding endpoints, agents, or data sources
